//The standard library consists of useful data structure called collections. 
//Collection is a data structure that can contain multiple values, the major difference between collections , array and tuple types, collections point are stored on the heap.
//With collections the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time, so collections data can grow or shrink as the program runs.

//Vectors Vec<T> helps us to store more than one value of the same type in a single data structure.
fn main(){

}
fn create_vector(){
    let mut v: Vec<u32> = Vec::new(); // to create an empty vector 
    let v = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
    // adding elements to a vector the push keyword is used.For us to update a vector the mut keyword has to be used.
